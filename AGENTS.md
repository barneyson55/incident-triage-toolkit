# AGENTS.md (rules for Codex / AI)

You are an AI coding agent working inside this repository.

## 0) Always read first
Before you do anything:
1) Read `docs/AI_EDIT_POLICY.md` and obey it strictly.
2) Read `README.md` for the current product intent and usage.
3) Read `docs/ai_todo.md` and select the **first unchecked top-level** task.
4) Read `docs/user_todo.md`:
   - If it contains **any** unchecked item, STOP and do not proceed.

## 1) Deterministic TODO workflow
- Only work on the **first** unchecked top-level item in `docs/ai_todo.md`.
- Do not start extra refactors or “while we’re here” work.
- If blocked or if user action is required:
  - Add **one** actionable checkbox item to `docs/user_todo.md`.
  - Explain what is needed.
  - STOP.

## 2) Definition of done (for every task)
When you finish a task from `docs/ai_todo.md`:
- Update `docs/status.md` with:
  - what you changed (file paths)
  - why
  - any risks / follow-ups
- Check off the task in `docs/ai_todo.md` (`- [x] ...`).

## 3) Quality bar
- Prefer simple, boring solutions.
- Avoid new dependencies unless truly required (and document why).
- Run lightweight checks when appropriate (`make lint`, `make test`).

## 4) No signature / watermark rule
- Do NOT add: “generated by AI”, model names, watermarks, or signatures anywhere.
