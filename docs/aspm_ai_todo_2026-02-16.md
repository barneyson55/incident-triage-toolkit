Top 3 actionable productization tasks for this rotation:

1. [ ] Define a release checklist with version bump, QA gate, rollback plan, and release notes template.
2. [ ] Publish SECURITY.md with vulnerability disclosure process and patch SLA expectations.
3. [ ] Start CHANGELOG.md with semantic-version sections so each shipped change is auditable.

Execution note:
- Keep tasks concrete, buyer-facing, and measurable.
